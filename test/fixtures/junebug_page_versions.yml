    To complete setup of you new wiki, here are a few things you should do:
    
    
    h3. 1. Login to your account
    
    When you created this wiki, the username and password you submitted were used to set up an account for you.  Now click the 'sign in' link at the upper right and sign in.
    
    Once you sign in you will see your username in the upper right corner.
    
    
    h3. 2. Set the start page
    
    This page will always be the default start page for a new wiki.  Probably not what you want, right?  Fortunately, it is easy to change.  Open the config.yml file (in your wiki directory) with any texteditor, and change the startpage field to the page you want.
    
    Next, in your wiki directory, run the command:
    
     ruby wiki restart
    
    The next time you click on the 'Home' link in the nav bar, you will be taken to your new start page.  If the page doesn't already exist, you will first be asked to login, and then you will be presented with an edit form to create the page.
    
    
    h3. 3. Create some pages!
    
    If you have any trouble, or need some help getting started, click on the 'Help' link in the nav bar.  The documentation is pretty sparse right now, but I'm working on it!
