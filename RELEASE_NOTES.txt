The wikiword syntax has changed slightly.  Starting in this version, wikiwords can not contain underscores. Furthermore, in page urls, spaces will now be replaced by underscores.  Example:

Invalid wikiword link syntax: [[Test_page]]

Valid wikiword link syntax:  [[Test page]]
Corresponding page url: http://www.wiki.com/Test_page

Also, you will notice that the page title is now presented in the page body rather than the header.  I was finding that the previous location in the header usually led me to rewrite the title in the body for clarity.

The database configuration in config.yml has been changed to allow easy support for databases other than sqlite3. Existing junebug installations will need to make the following changes:

In config.yml, add the following lines:

dbconnection:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: junebug.db

And be sure to use spaces to indent!

Existing junebug installations will need to make the following changes:

# The name of the gem has changed to junebug-wiki.  This means that to update junebug, you will need to:

gem uninstall junebug
gem install junebug-wiki

# An additional configuration parameter was added to config.yml.  To update existing wikis, add the parameter:

feedtitle: 'Wiki Updates'

# The 'static' directory has been renamed to 'public'.  You will need to rename this directory manually, or just run 'rake update:deploydir'.

Sorry for all the instability -- but I figure it is better now when the userbase is 3 than a month from now when it's 30 (ha!)

The wikiword syntax changed in this release from just straight WikiLink to [[WikiLink]].  Just using camelcase was having trouble coexisting with textile, so I opted instead for the instiki convention which is less problematic.

This change will reqire updating any pre-existing pages to the new wikiword syntax.

Note that this format also supports the [[WikiLink|different label]] syntax.
