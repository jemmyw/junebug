Existing junebug installations will need to make the following changes:

# The name of the gem has changed to junebug-wiki.  This means that to update junebug, you will need to:

gem uninstall junebug
gem install junebug-wiki

# An additional configuration parameter was added to config.yml.  To update existing wikis, add the parameter:

feedtitle: 'Wiki Updates'

# The 'static' directory has been renamed to 'public'.  You will need to rename this directory manually.

Sorry for all the instability -- but I figure it is better now when the userbase is 3 than a month from now when it's 30 (ha!)

The wikiword syntax changed in this release from just straight WikiLink to [[WikiLink]].  Just using camelcase was having trouble coexisting with textile, so I opted instead for the instiki convention which is less problematic.

This change will reqire updating any pre-existing pages to the new wikiword syntax.

Note that this format also supports the [[WikiLink|different label]] syntax.
