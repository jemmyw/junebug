The name of the gem has changed to junebug-wiki.  This means that to update junebug, you will need to:

gem uninstall junebug
gem install junebug-wiki

Also, an additional configuration parameter was added to config.yml.  Existing wikis should add the parameter:

feedtitle: 'Wiki Updates'

The wikiword syntax changed in this release from just straight WikiLink to [[WikiLink]].  Just using camelcase was having trouble coexisting with textile, so I opted instead for the instiki convention which is less problematic.

This change will reqire updating any pre-existing pages to the new wikiword syntax.

Note that this format also supports the [[WikiLink|different label]] syntax.
